/** 
 *  @brief 
 * "Search" function will search(by using the linked list formed and searching by strstr library function and searches by traversing through the linked lsit received as argument) the timestamp given as an input from the file data.csv and displays the coresponding values needed like sample value, MLII value and V5 value. and its returns no value.
 * "parse" function will store the data.csv file content into a data Structure called in a single link list(by FILE handling concepts like fopen and storing into the link list by traversing through the list) and returns the inital (starting, i.e head) node address to the head pointer which is declared in main function.
 *  "Search" function have no return value so, void and it accepts an argument which is of structure pointer type.
 *  "parse" function has a return value which of structure pointer type and in which structure is globally declared and it accepts an argument structure pointer type.
 *
 * structure has two members one is sample which is char type and it is an array. another member is pointer to the structure itself which self referential structure.
